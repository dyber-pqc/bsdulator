# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of background or
identity.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private unwelcome conduct
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders
responsible for enforcement at:

**zkleckner@dyber.org**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All
community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences
for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Minor issues like use of inappropriate language.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature
of the issue. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: A pattern of behavior or a single more serious incident.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved for a specified period. This includes
avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating
these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent restriction.

### 3. Temporary Restriction

**Impact**: A serious or sustained pattern of inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary restriction from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private
interaction with the people involved is permitted during this period. Violating
these terms may lead to a permanent restriction.

### 4. Permanent Restriction

**Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of inappropriate behavior including sustained
inappropriate conduct or targeting of individuals.

within the community.
